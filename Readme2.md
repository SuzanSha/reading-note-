# what I learned 
Actually I learned a lot during the past days ,
I learned about HTML , CSS and today about markdown 
It is light weight language that generates HTML 
It's very easy to use and fast.
  
# flash cards
- HTML and tags 


# Notes 
1. HTML is for structure 
2. CSS is for presentation 
3. Javascript is for actions
 
## HTML and CSS are not programming languages 
## Javascript is programming language 
## HTML and CSS and Javascript are used in the front end
